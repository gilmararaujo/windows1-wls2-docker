# Installation script of wsl2, docker and some more software using chocolatey on windows
To Configure WSL2 and docker in MS-Windows environments is not a pleasant task. So, I had decided develop a script in powershell that helps in the process of configuring the development environment using wsl2, docker and chocolatey while I was using MS-Windows 10.
I hope you enjoy. Enjoy it. :)
